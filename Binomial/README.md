Hello!

Welcome to workout03: the Binomial Package. 

In this project, I wrote functions with methods and tests that allow us to explore the nature of binomial distributions and binomial variables. I then used the devtools package to pack my code into a downloadable package that all other R users can dowload and enjoy. 

Enjoy the Binomial Package I created!
