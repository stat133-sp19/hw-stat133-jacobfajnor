Hi! Welcom to Workout02: Finaincail Modalities in the Shiny app.

In this project I took three key critical finaincal concepts for how to assess the furture values of certain assets and then created an interactive user interface to change parameters and seee how savings react. 

There are 5 sliders for each numeric input and one drop down menu for wherther the output plot is faceted or not. There is also a table that displays the values at individual data points based upon the variable input. 

I used the packages shiny, reshape2, and ggplot so make sure those are installed before trying to run this code.

Enjoy the App!
