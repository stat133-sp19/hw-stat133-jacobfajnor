![Finished Coconut Cake](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/plush-coconut-cake-vegan.jpg?w=1024)

#### Ingredients:

-   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons (285 grams) all-purpose flour
-   1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
-   1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
-   1/2 cup (110 grams) coconut oil, warmed just enough to liquefy
-   1 1/2 cups full- or low-fat coconut milk (see Note)
-   1 tablespoon (15 ml) plain vinegar

#### Kitchen tools

-   Whisk
-   **9 inch** cake pan
-   Parchment paper

#### Directions

Set oven to preheat to 350 degrees and prepare you baking pan with parchment paper and non stick spray.

Mix all of your dry ingredents together and whisk unitl well blended.Add the coconut milk, vinegar, and coconut oil to dry ingredents and whisk unitl the batter is smooth.

Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a fork placed in the center of the cake can be removed with no excess batter on it. Remove from the pan and place on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.

Decorate with any topings and frostings you would like.

Enjoy!

#### Variation

Add a glaze by whisking toghether 3/4 cup powdered sugar with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the leftover coconut milk. Once the cake has cooled, spread over the top of the cake with a spachula or knife. Allow glaze to set before serving.

#### Season

Enjoy year round!

Euclidean Distance
==================

Definition
----------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{pq}$).

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates), if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

d(**p**,**q**) = (**q**,**p**) = $\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+\\dots+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$Â 

= $\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{\\infty}(q\_i - p\_i)^2}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Eucledian vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector) So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points.[**Eucledean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or **Eucledean lenght**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

||*p*|| = $\\sqrt{p\_1 ^2 + p\_2 ^2 + \\dots + p\_n ^2}$ = $\\sqrt{p.p}$
